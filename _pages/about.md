<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Master's student at **City University of Hong Kong (Dongguan)** and visiting student in **Great Bay University** supervised by **Zitong Yu**, Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence from **Jilin University** in 2025.

My research interests include **Micro-expression Recognition**, **Micro-expression AUs Detection**, and **Large Language Models**. I am currently focusing on intelligent analysis of micro-expressions using large models and agents to identify hidden emotional states.

I have published a paper at conference such as CCBR. (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yIlUO94AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
